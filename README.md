## Getting started with EEROS on the BeagleBone® Blue

On the NTB wiki, there is a [step-by-step procedure](https://wiki.ntb.ch/infoportal/software/linux/beagleboneblue) to set up this project. This project contains a toolchain file for cross development. The EEROS application is developed on a Linux host machine and deployed to the BBB. The project configuration is done in the file [**config.sh.in**](https://github.com/ntb-ch/BeagleBoneBlue/blob/master/config.sh.in).
